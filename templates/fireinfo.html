    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Plan Evacuation Destinations and Routes:</strong></p>
    <p>
        • Be aware of evacuation destinations where you could seek shelter, such as a friend's or family member's home or a nearby evacuation shelter.
        <br>• Identify at least two escape routes from your location to your intended evacuation destination.
        <br><strong>For the Elderly and Those With Disabilities:</strong> Plan ahead for accessible transportation if needed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3. Stay Informed:</strong></p>
    <p>
        • Monitor local alerts, weather updates, and fire warnings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>4. Follow Authorities’ Instructions:</strong></p>
    <p>
        If evacuation is ordered, leave immediately with your emergency supply kit.
    </p>

    <p><strong>5. Protect Your Home:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Close and lock doors and windows.
        <br>If time allows:
